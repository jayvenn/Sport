# Sport - iOS Demo Project

## Architecture: MVVM

### Core Components

- **Model**: The data shown on the views.
- **View**: The user interface shown to the end user
- **ViewModel**: Updates the models from view inputs and updates the views from model outputs.

### Benefits:

- Reduce view controllers' complexity.
- Increase business logic expressiveness.
- Make testing business logic easier without needing to worry about the view implementation and vice versa.

## Modules

- **FootballCore**: Foundational football models.
- **FootballAWS**: Football networking layer.
- **FootballUI**: Football user interfaces.
- **MainApp**: Executable iOS app bundle.


## Frameworks

- **UIKit**: Build the app's user interface using Apple's most mature and extensive UI-building framework.
- **Combine**: Process events and values over time using Apple's declarative reactive programming framework.

## Libraries

- **SDWebImage**: Remote image caching.
